# ruby API client for Zap proxy

A ruby client to access the HTTP API from Zap Proxy (http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ruby-zap'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-zap

## Usage

The main idea is to offer the infrastructure to access the Zap proxy via ruby.
For now you are able to define a proxy address, start a scan/spider, get the report, shutdown the proxy and etc
